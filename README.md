ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ashutosh Tripathi

I'm a Pre-Final Year Student. Pursuing BTech in Electronics and communication. I Love to work on web development projects and seeking exciting opportunities for the same.

I have worked with several technologies and some of them include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node-js, Mongodb, Express js, Ajex, Restful api, Git and GitHub etc.

I am good at analysing and problem solving. I believe in "The Problem is not solved unless it's Done in the most optimized way."
